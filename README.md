### About me :)
  I'm an undergraduate **computer engineering** student currently interested in backend app development, UI Design, and software + hardware systems.
  My goal is to strengthen my skills in development and explore new technologies. Currently, I'm working on building small projects
  to build upon my current knowledge. I love building things that are creative and helpful for others!
